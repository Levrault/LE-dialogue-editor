## Can this application be useful for you?

If you want to create a **visual novel** or a **story-driven game with non-linear story**, this application **shouldn't** be your first choice. Why? Because managing heavy dialogue in a tree view will be simply too hard to maintain.  That why you should those applications instead

- [Dialogic](https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic) a plug-in for Godot Engine by Emilio Coppola
- [Twinejs](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs) a port of Twine
- [Renpy](https://www.renpy.org/) a visual novel engine
- [Visual Novel Maker](http://visualnovelmaker.com/) a visual novel engine

- Character name and portrait
- Choices
